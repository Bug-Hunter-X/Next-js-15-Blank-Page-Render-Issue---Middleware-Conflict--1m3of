# Next.js 15 Blank Page Render Bug

This repository demonstrates a peculiar rendering issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application.  The application inexplicably renders a blank page, with no apparent errors in the browser console.  This seems to be caused by an interaction between middleware and custom components, specifically highlighting a possible edge case or uncommon bug within the Next.js 15 framework.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the blank page rendering in the browser.
